# Fluid Framework v2.0.0-internal.7.4.0

## Deprecate FluidStatic Classes

This change deprecates a number of unnecessarily exposed FluidStatic classes, and replaces them with creation functions. This helps us keep implementations decoupled from usage which is easier to maintain and extend. It has very minimal impact on the public surface area of downstream packages. The deprecated classes are as follows:

- AzureAudience
- TinyliciousAudience
- DOProviderContainerRuntimeFactory
- FluidContainer
- ServiceAudience

## Deprecate API `findOverlappingIntervals` from `IntervalCollection`, this functionality is moved to the `OverlappingIntervalsIndex`. Users are advised to independently attach the index to the collection and utilize the API accordingly, for instance:

```typescript
const overlappingIntervalsIndex = createOverlappingIntervalsIndex(sharedString);
collection.attachIndex(overlappingIntervalsIndex);
const result = overlappingIntervalsIndex.findOverlappingIntervals(start, end);
```

## Deprecate ICombiningOp, PropertiesRollback.Rewrite, and SharedString.annotateMarkerNotifyConsensus

This change deprecates usage of ICombiningOp in various APIs, including SharedSegmentSequence.annotateRange and SharedString.annotateMarker. It also deprecates SharedString.annotateMarkerNotifyConsensus which is related to combining ops. This functionality had no test coverage and was largely unused.

## Deprecate API `previousInterval` and `nextInterval` from `IntervalCollection`, these functionalities are moved to the `EndpointIndex`. Users are advised to independently attach the index to the collection and utilize the API accordingly, for instance:

```typescript
const endpointIndex = createEndpointIndex(sharedString);
collection.attachIndex(endpointIndex);

const result1 = endpointIndex.previousInterval(pos);
const result2 = endpointIndex.nextInterval(pos);
```

## Deprecate logIfFalse

This functionality was not intended for export and will be removed in a future release. No replacement API is offered, as the logic is trivial to reproduce as needed.

## Deprecated `IRootDataObjectFactory`

The `IRootDataObjectFactory` interface has been deprecated and will be removed in a future major release. Please remove all usage of it.

## Move config base types from telemetry-utils to core-interfaces

The types ConfigTypes, and IConfigProviderBase have been deprecated in the @fluidframework/telemetry-utils and copied to the @fluidframework/core-interfaces. Please update your reference to use these types from @fluidframework/core-interfaces.

## GC: Tombstoned objects will fail to load by default

Previously, by default Tombstoned objects would merely trigger informational logs, with an option via config to also cause errors to be thrown on load. Now failure to load is the default, with an option to disable it if necessary. This reflects the purpose of Tombstone stage which is to mimic the user experience of having objects deleted.
