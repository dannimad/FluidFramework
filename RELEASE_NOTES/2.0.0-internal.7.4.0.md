# Upcoming changes in Fluid Framework v2.0.0-internal.7.4.0

## azure-client: Deprecate FluidStatic Classes

Several FluidStatic classes were unnecessarily exposed. They have been replaced with creation functions. This helps us keep implementations decoupled from usage which is easier to maintain and extend. It has very minimal impact on the public surface area of downstream packages. The deprecated classes are as follows:

- `AzureAudience` (use `IAzureAudience` instead)
- `TinyliciousAudience` (use `ITinyliciousAudience` instead)
- `DOProviderContainerRuntimeFactory`
- `FluidContainer`
- `ServiceAudience`

## sequence: Deprecated findOverlappingIntervals API

The `findOverlappingIntervals` API from `IntervalCollection` has been deprecated. This functionality is moved to the `OverlappingIntervalsIndex`. Users should independently attach the index to the collection and utilize the API accordingly, for instance:

```typescript
const overlappingIntervalsIndex = createOverlappingIntervalsIndex(sharedString);
collection.attachIndex(overlappingIntervalsIndex);
const result = overlappingIntervalsIndex.findOverlappingIntervals(start, end);
```

## sequence: Deprecated ICombiningOp, PropertiesRollback.Rewrite, and SharedString.annotateMarkerNotifyConsensus

The `ICombiningOp` and its usage in various APIs has been deprecated. APIs affected include `SharedSegmentSequence.annotateRange` and `SharedString.annotateMarker`. `SharedString.annotateMarkerNotifyConsensus` has also been deprecated, because it is related to combining ops. This functionality had no test coverage and was largely unused.

## sequence: Deprecated previousInterval and nextInterval APIs

The `previousInterval` and `nextInterval` APIs from `IntervalCollection` have been deprecated. These functions are moved to the `EndpointIndex`. Users should independently attach the index to the collection and utilize the API accordingly, for instance:

```typescript
const endpointIndex = createEndpointIndex(sharedString);
collection.attachIndex(endpointIndex);

const result1 = endpointIndex.previousInterval(pos);
const result2 = endpointIndex.nextInterval(pos);
```

## telemetry-utils: Deprecated logIfFalse

This functionality was not intended for export and will be removed in a future release. No replacement API is offered because the logic is trivial to reproduce as needed.

## aqueduct: Deprecated IRootDataObjectFactory

The `IRootDataObjectFactory` interface has been deprecated and will be removed in a future major release. Please remove all usage of it.

## telemetry-utils: Deprecate ConfigTypes and IConfigProviderBase

The types `ConfigTypes` and `IConfigProviderBase` have been deprecated in the @fluidframework/telemetry-utils package. The types can now be found in the @fluidframework/core-interfaces package. Please replace any uses with the types from @fluidframework/core-interfaces.

## container-runtime: (GC) Tombstoned objects will fail to load by default

Previously, Tombstoned objects would only trigger informational logs by default, with an option via config to also cause errors to be thrown on load. Now, failure to load is the default with an option to disable it if necessary. This reflects the purpose of the Tombstone stage which is to mimic the user experience of objects being deleted.
