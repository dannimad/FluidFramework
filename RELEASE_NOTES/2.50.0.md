## Other Changes

### StateFactory.latest now accepts a validator parameter ([#24432](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/24432))

The StateFactory.latest API now accepts a `validator` argument. The `validator` is a function that will be called at runtime to verify that the data is valid. This is especially useful when changing the schema of presence data.

See [the presence documentation](https://fluidframework.com/docs/build/presence) for more details.
